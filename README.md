## Technical Information

This tool runs entirely in your browser - no server processing is required, ensuring your text remains private. The analyzer uses modern JavaScript to process text and perform statistical analysis based on the selected language system.

Language detection algorithms are tailored to handle different writing systems appropriately, including languages without clear word boundaries like Chinese and Japanese.
